# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hæ, I’m @Patrikur, a junior level web developer.
You can find the code for my current projects as well as my portfolio in my [repository](https://github.com/Patrikur/Patrikur.github.io) where you can find documentation as well. Most of the pages are published with GitHub Pages.
I’m currently learning to setup a proper backend with Node.JS & MySQL to implement headless CMS solutions in two projects.
I'm proficient with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Python, and Node.JS.
