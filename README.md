# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hæ, I’m @Patrikur, a web developer based in Reykjavík, Iceland.
I love crafting beautiful and functional web applications.
My goal? To make the web a better place, one line of code at a time.
Got an idea and need some help bringing it to life?
Let's talk, I am happy to help!
